# Hyperutil

This is a small utility script to remap the Caps-Lock key on your Mac to the F18 key to eventually use it as the hyper key.

This only needs to be run once. You will need node installed (I couldn't get a bash script to work well, unfortunately).

To run this quickly use

```curl -fSSL todo-path-to-script | node```

or, alternatively with `wget`, run

```wget -q todo-path-to-script -O- | node```

or, lastly, checkout the repo and run `node capsLockOnHyperdrive.js`
